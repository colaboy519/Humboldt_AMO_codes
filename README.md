# Humboldt_AMO_codes
This repository stores the python codes used to run the FORTRAN calculation codes for hydrogen, hydrogen molecule in AMO group at Humboldt. 

Since these codes are more like helper codes to make use of the FORRTAN codes, they don't contain any sensitive calculation-related information. Hence I am putting them up here in public for ease of reference and whoever finds them useful in case someone is following up with my project done Humbolt, AMO group in summer 2023 related to simulting Rydberg atom orbitals in an optical lattice using numerical methods.
